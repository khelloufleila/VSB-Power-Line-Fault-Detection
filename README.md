# VSB-Power-Line-Fault-Detection


ENET Centre researches and develops renewable energy resources with the goal of reducing or eliminating harmful environmental impacts. Their efforts focus on developing technology solutions around transportation and processing of energy raw materials

In this work I developed a solution using machine learning algorithms and feature extrcation to detect partial discharge and help ENET to reduce maintenance costs, and prevent power outages.
